Graph Mining is an important research field focusing on mining interesting patterns in graph data. To help users mine graph data, Nijith Jacob and Sharif Doghmi developed a SQL-based tool: GraphMiner. In this project, we enhanced GraphMiner, analyzed graph data, and provided friendly scripts for using.  
\\
\\
We strengthened GraphMiner in two ways: First, we added K-core detection algorithm into GraphMiner. Second, we conducted experiments of indexing to accelerate computing time, and found out a good setting for indexing. 
\\
\\
Moreover, we used revised GraphMiner to analyze 20 graphs in vary dimensions: degree distribution, triangle counting, weakly connected component, pagerank, eigenvalues, and K-core. We found some general patterns across these 20 graphs. Also, we discovered some strange patterns in some of graphs.

Besides, we provided an user-friendly script to help users to analyze data: "easy.sh" and a script for unti-test in makefile, "make test". Please check the code in our package.

This report is organized as follows: in section 2, we summarized related work. In section 3, we described our K-core algorithm implementation with details. In section 4, we provided some sample graphs for unit test. In section 5, we described how we did the indexing experiments. Finally, in section 6, we used revised GraphMiner to analyze 20 graphs.
