We implemented K-core algorithm into GraphMiner, and used indexing technology to speed up execution time. According to the experiments, the indexing method can  reduce computing time.

\\
Besides, we used revised GraphMiner to analyze 20 graphs in different aspects. We found global patterns across  graphs, and some special patterns in some graphs.

Last, we provided friendly scripts to analyze graph and to do unit test. These scripts can be found in graphminer directory.
